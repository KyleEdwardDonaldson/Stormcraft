---

## üéÆ Commands

### Player Commands
- `/storm` - Check closest storm status (distance, direction, time remaining)
- `/storms` - List all active storms
- `/storm ui` - Toggle storm UI display mode (action bar / boss bar)
- `/storm infuse` - Place infusion pedestal (requires Stormcraft-Essence)

### Admin Commands

/storm next 0                   # Start countdown now
```

---

## üîë Permissions

- `stormcraft.view` - See storm announcements (default: true)
- `stormcraft.admin` - All admin commands (default: op)
  - `stormcraft.admin.start` - Force start storms
  - `stormcraft.admin.stop` - Stop active storms
  - `stormcraft.admin.next` - Control storm timing
  - `stormcraft.admin.reload` - Reload config
  - `stormcraft.admin.test` - Test damage

---

## üéØ Storm Tracker Setup (Traveling Storms)

When traveling storms are enabled, the plugin displays real-time storm tracking via **ActionBar** or **BossBar** instead of global chat announcements.

### Configuration

```yaml
stormTracker:
  mode: "actionbar"  # Options: "actionbar" or "bossbar"
  range: 1000        # Distance in blocks to show tracker
  updateInterval: 20 # Update frequency in ticks (20 = 1 second)
```

### Display Modes

**ActionBar Mode** (Recommended)
- Shows compact storm info above hotbar
- Example: `‚õà STORM NW 450m`
- Color-coded by distance:
  - üî¥ Red (< 100 blocks) - DANGER!
  - üü° Yellow (100-300 blocks) - Warning
  - üîµ Blue (> 300 blocks) - Distant
- Changes to `‚ö° IN STORM ‚ö°` when inside damage radius

**BossBar Mode**
- Shows persistent bar at top of screen
- Progress bar fills as storm approaches
- Color changes with distance (blue ‚Üí yellow ‚Üí red)
- Title shows direction and distance
- More visible but takes up more screen space

### Setup Steps

1. **Enable zones and traveling storms** in `config.yml`:
   ```yaml
   zones:
     enabled: true
     # ... zone configuration

   travelingStorms:
     enabled: true
     damageRadius: 50.0
   ```

2. **Configure storm tracker** (optional - uses defaults above):
   ```yaml
   stormTracker:
     mode: "actionbar"  # or "bossbar"
     range: 1000
     updateInterval: 20
   ```

3. **Restart server**

### How It Works

- Players see storm info **only when within range** (default 1000 blocks)
- Displays **cardinal direction** (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) and distance
- **No global announcements** when traveling storms enabled (tracker replaces them)
- Works with `/storm` command to check status anytime

### Warning Times by Storm Type

With 1000 block range and 50 block damage radius:

| Storm Type     | Speed Range | Warning Time      |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Short Weak     | 0.5-2.0 b/s | 8-33 minutes      |
| Medium         | 0.15-0.5 b/s| 33-111 minutes    |
| Long Dangerous | 0.03-0.2 b/s| 83-555+ minutes   |

*Note: Dangerous storms move very slowly and can be visible for hours before arrival!*

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Map Integration Setup

Stormcraft supports **Dynmap**, **squaremap**, and **BlueMap** for visualizing zones and active storms.

### Setup (All Maps)

1. **Install your preferred map plugin:**
   - [Dynmap](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/dynmap.274/) (SpigotMC)
   - [squaremap](https://github.com/jpenilla/squaremap) (GitHub)
   - [BlueMap](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/bluemap.83557/) (SpigotMC)

2. **Enable zones** in Stormcraft config:
   ```yaml
   zones:
     enabled: true
   ```

3. **Restart server**

4. **Access your map** (default ports):
   - Dynmap: `http://your-server:8123`
   - squaremap: `http://your-server:8080`

### What You'll See

**All maps show:**
- üî¥ Red circle = Stormlands (high danger)
- üü† Orange circle = Storm Zone
- üü¢ Green circle = Safe Zone
- üü£ Purple markers = Active storm locations with damage radius

**Multiple Storms:**
When using erratic spawning, you'll see up to 6 simultaneous storms on the map, each with their own damage radius circles.

---

## üåç Custom World Generation

Stormcraft includes an optional custom world generator that creates **thematically perfect storm worlds** with ring-based biome distribution.

### How It Works

The generator uses distance from world center (0,0) to determine which biomes spawn:

**Ring 1: Stormlands Core (0-2500 blocks)**
- Biomes: Jagged Peaks, Frozen Peaks, Stony Peaks, Windswept Hills
- Terrain: Dramatic mountains (y=150+), harsh peaks
- Structures: Ancient Cities, Strongholds, Mineshafts
- Theme: Most dangerous, apocalyptic wasteland

**Ring 2: Storm Zone (2500-5000 blocks)**
- Biomes: Plains, Sunflower Plains, Savanna, Meadow
- Terrain: Open, rolling hills
- Structures: Villages, Pillager Outposts
- Theme: Exposed, moderate danger

**Ring 3: Safe Zone (5000-10000 blocks)**
- Biomes: Dark Forest, Jungle, Taiga, Swamp, Mangrove
- Terrain: Dense forests, natural shelter
- Structures: Woodland Mansions, Jungle Temples, Witch Huts
- Theme: Protected, buildable, safe

**Ring 4: Outer Wilds (10000+ blocks)**
- Biomes: All vanilla biomes (normal distribution)
- Terrain: Standard Minecraft
- Structures: Everything vanilla
- Theme: Normal gameplay

### Setup Instructions

1. **Install Multiverse-Core** (recommended world manager):
   ```
   https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-core
   ```

2. **Create new world with Stormcraft generator:**
   ```
   /mv create stormworld normal -g Stormcraft
   ```

3. **Configure zones** (use same center as world generation):
   ```yaml
   zones:
     enabled: true
     centerX: 0  # Must match world center
     centerZ: 0  # Must match world center
   ```

4. **Teleport to new world:**
   ```
   /mv tp stormworld
   ```

### Features

‚úÖ **Uses vanilla biomes** - No custom biomes, full compatibility
‚úÖ **Vanilla structures work** - Villages, temples, mansions spawn naturally
‚úÖ **Smooth transitions** - Biomes blend naturally over 300 blocks
‚úÖ **Noise-based variation** - Not perfect circles, natural-looking
‚úÖ **Works with existing worlds** - Only applies to NEW worlds created with generator
‚úÖ **Performance optimized** - Minimal overhead, async generation

### What Players Experience

```
Spawn in Safe Zone ‚Üí Dark forests, natural shelter
Walk 5000 blocks ‚Üí Terrain opens up, plains and savannas appear
Walk 2500 blocks ‚Üí Dramatic mountains loom, storms intensify
Reach center (0,0) ‚Üí Highest peaks, deadliest storms, best loot
```

### Important Notes

- **Cannot modify existing worlds** - Only works for NEW world creation
- **Reuses existing storm spawn weights** - Biome preferences from config apply
- **Loot scales naturally** - Vanilla structures have better loot in dangerous zones (see below)
- **Map integrations work** - Dynmap/squaremap show zone boundaries perfectly

---

## üìä PlaceholderAPI

Available placeholders when PlaceholderAPI is installed:

- `%stormcraft_status%` - Current status (idle/countdown/active)
- `%stormcraft_time%` - Time until next storm / remaining duration
- `%stormcraft_type%` - Upcoming/active storm type
- `%stormcraft_damage%` - Storm damage per second

---

## üéØ Gameplay Strategy

### Without Zones (Traditional Mode)
- Build secure shelters with solid roofs
- Monitor countdown warnings
- Stay indoors during storms
- Earn essence by surviving exposure (requires Stormcraft-Essence)

### With Zones (Stormlands Mode)
- **Safe Zone**: Safe building, slow progression
- **Storm Zone**: Moderate risk for faster progression
- **Stormlands**: Highest risk/reward
  - Buildings degrade over time
  - Frequent dangerous storms
  - Best loot and resources
  - Ancient debris spawns naturally
  - Need supply lines to Safe Zone for storage

**Risk vs Reward Balance:**
- Stormlands offers 3x rewards but constant danger
- Block damage prevents permanent settlement
- Players must brave storms for rare resources
- Economy creates trading opportunities

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Building for Development

```bash
git clone <repository>
cd stormcraft
mvn clean package
```

Output: `target/stormcraft-0.1.0.jar`

**Requirements:**
- JDK 17+
- Maven 3.6+

---

## üìù Configuration Tips

### Balanced Server (Recommended)
- Enable zones for endgame content
- Keep traveling storms enabled for dynamic gameplay
- Use **ActionBar mode** for storm tracker (less intrusive)
- Set Stormlands radius to 2500 blocks (small but rewarding)
- Set tracker range to 1000 blocks (3+ minutes warning)
- Enable all resource systems (drops, ore gen, block damage)

### Hardcore Server
- Increase storm frequency (lower delays)
- Increase damage values
- Enable block damage
- Higher lightning chances
- Reduce essence rewards to make risks feel more significant

### Casual Server
- Disable zones (traditional mode)
- Longer delays between storms
- Lower damage values
- More weak storms, fewer dangerous
- Disable block damage

### Performance Optimization
- Disable ore generation if not needed
- Reduce `maxChecksPerTick` for block damage
- Increase check intervals
- Limit storm drop frequency

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Players taking damage while sheltered:**
- Check `logExposureSamples: true` for debugging
- Verify `treatGlassAsCover` / `treatLeavesAsCover` settings
- Ensure `ignoreIfUnderBlocksMinDepth: 1` is correct
- Check WorldGuard regions aren't interfering

**Zones not appearing on map:**
- Verify your map plugin (Dynmap/squaremap) is installed
- Check `zones.enabled: true`
- Restart server after config changes
- Check console for map integration initialization messages
- Try both map plugins - at least one should work!

**Storms not starting:**
- Check enabled worlds list
- Verify no other weather plugins conflict
- Check console for errors
- Try `/storm next 0` to force countdown

**Performance issues:**
- Disable ore generation if not using zones
- Reduce block damage checks
- Lower storm drop frequency
- Increase task intervals
