---

## üîë Permissions

- `stormcraft.view` - See storm announcements (default: true)
- `stormcraft.admin` - All admin commands (default: op)
  - `stormcraft.admin.start` - Force start storms
  - `stormcraft.admin.stop` - Stop active storms
  - `stormcraft.admin.next` - Control storm timing
  - `stormcraft.admin.reload` - Reload config

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Dynmap Setup

1. **Install Dynmap** plugin (download from SpigotMC)
2. **Enable zones** in Stormcraft config:
   ```yaml
   zones:
     enabled: true
   ```
3. **Restart server**
4. **Access Dynmap** at `http://your-server-ip:8123`

**What you'll see:**
- üî¥ Red circle = Stormlands (high danger)
- üü† Orange circle = Storm Zone
- üü¢ Green circle = Safe Zone
- üü£ Purple marker = Active storm location (when traveling storms enabled)

---

## üìä PlaceholderAPI

Available placeholders when PlaceholderAPI is installed:

- `%stormcraft_status%` - Current status (idle/countdown/active)
- `%stormcraft_time%` - Time until next storm / remaining duration
- `%stormcraft_type%` - Upcoming/active storm type
- `%stormcraft_damage%` - Storm damage per second

---

## üéØ Gameplay Strategy

### Without Zones (Traditional Mode)
- Build secure shelters with solid roofs
- Monitor countdown warnings
- Stay indoors during storms
- Earn essence by surviving exposure

### With Zones (Stormlands Mode)
- **Safe Zone**: Safe building, slow progression
- **Storm Zone**: Moderate risk for faster progression
- **Stormlands**: Highest risk/reward
  - Buildings degrade over time
  - Frequent dangerous storms
  - Best loot and resources
  - Ancient debris spawns naturally
  - Need supply lines to Safe Zone for storage

**Risk vs Reward Balance:**
- Stormlands offers 3x rewards but constant danger
- Block damage prevents permanent settlement
- Players must brave storms for rare resources
- Economy creates trading opportunities

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Building for Development

```bash
git clone <repository>
cd stormcraft
mvn clean package
```

Output: `target/stormcraft-0.1.0.jar`

**Requirements:**
- JDK 17+
- Maven 3.6+

## üìù Configuration Tips

### Balanced Server (Recommended)
- Enable zones for endgame content
- Keep traveling storms enabled for dynamic gameplay
- Set Stormlands radius to 2500 blocks (small but rewarding)
- Enable all resource systems (drops, ore gen, block damage)

### Hardcore Server
- Increase storm frequency (lower delays)
- Increase damage values
- Enable block damage
- Higher lightning chances
- Reduce essence rewards to make risks feel more significant

### Casual Server
- Disable zones (traditional mode)
- Longer delays between storms
- Lower damage values
- More weak storms, fewer dangerous
- Disable block damage

### Performance Optimization
- Disable ore generation if not needed
- Reduce `maxChecksPerTick` for block damage
- Increase check intervals
- Limit storm drop frequency

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Players taking damage while sheltered:**
- Check `logExposureSamples: true` for debugging
- Verify `treatGlassAsCover` / `treatLeavesAsCover` settings
- Ensure `ignoreIfUnderBlocksMinDepth: 1` is correct
- Check WorldGuard regions aren't interfering

**Zones not appearing on Dynmap:**
- Verify Dynmap is installed
- Check `zones.enabled: true`
- Restart server after config changes
- Check console for Dynmap initialization errors

**Storms not starting:**
- Check enabled worlds list
- Verify no other weather plugins conflict
- Check console for errors
- Try `/stormcraft next 0` to force countdown

**Performance issues:**
- Disable ore generation if not using zones
- Reduce block damage checks
- Lower storm drop frequency
- Increase task intervals
